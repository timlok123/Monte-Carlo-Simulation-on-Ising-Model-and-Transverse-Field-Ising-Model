# SRF-Ising-model

## Description

This GitHub Repository is set up to store the code of my Summer Research Fellowships (SRF) project on Monte Carle simulation of classical Ising model and transverse field Ising model. My project includes the implementation/study of, 

1. Metropolis algorithm, Wolff algorithms and Swendsen Wang algorithms in updating classical Ising model 
2. Binder Cumulant and Finite Size Scaling 
3. Autocorrelation of Metropolis algorithm, Wolff algorithms and Swendsen Wang algorithms 
4. Metropolis algorithm, Wolff algorithms and Swendsen Wang algorithms in updating tranverse field Ising mode

There are 2 main motivations for me setting to set up this repository 

1. To back up my code for my SRF project 
2. To serve as a reference for people to use my code. 

Detailed description of the purpose of the code will be explained in the Report. 

## Content

1. [Report](./Research%20synopsis%20(for%20GitHub%20repo).pdf) - detailed explanation on the design of the code, theory behind and the result 
2. [My jupyter notebook](./SRF_Ising_model_updated.ipynb) - where all my code stored 

## How to Install and Run the code

I am using Microsoft Visual Studio Code(attach the link https://code.visualstudio.com/) to run the jupyter Notebook.  

You can also using uploading the code to Google drive and run it in Google Colab. 

## Libraries 
1. numpy 
2. ccipy 
3. matplotlib 
4. pandas 

## Credit

I would like to express my gratitude to Dr Zi Yang Meng for his support in this programme. I would also like to thank you Mr Wang Ting Tung and Mr Ngan Tsz Chun for their support.
